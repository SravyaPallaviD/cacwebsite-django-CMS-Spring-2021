                <h1>Forensic Interview</h1>
                <p>Forensic interviews are provided in a safe, child friendly location where children suspected of being victims of abuse are interviewed in connection with the crime.
                <p>The forensic interview is a structured unbiased fact finding conversation with a child intended to elicit detailed information about a possible event or events that the child may have experienced or witnessed.</p>
                
                <p>Department of Children’s Services and law enforcement receive all child abuse reports. They request that the Child Advocacy Center conducts a forensic interview. The child may have been the victim of child physical abuse, child sexual abuse, exposed to their parents drug use, or they may have witnessed a violent crime, such as domestic violence or homicide.</p>
                
                <p>Sometimes a child may require an extended forensic interview. The extended forensic interview is a multi-session structured interview. Some children may need more than one session and up to four sessions to talk about allegations of abuse. An extended forensic interview is utilized for children with special developmental considerations or children who are particularly anxious or frightened.
                    The Child Advocacy Center has two forensic interviewers and two back-up forensic interviewers that interview Rutherford and Cannon County child victims. All of the forensic interviewers have received extensive specialized training to respond to child abuse, child sexual abuse, drug endangered children, and child witnesses to violence crime cases. The forensic interviewers participate in professional trainings and quarterly peer review to continually improve their skills. The team triages emergency child abuse cases, prioritizes cases, and responds to child victims who are in eminent danger.</p>
